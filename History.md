This is part 1 of the semester programming language project for CS330 at Simmons University (Fall 2023)

## History of JavaScript

JavaScript, or JS, is one of several programming languages at the core of website design and function. It is frequently used in conjunction with HTML and CSS and should not be confused with Java, which is its own language. JavaScript is used on the client side by over 98% of websites for webpage behavior.

### Inventor
Javascript was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich. It was developed for Netscape 2, and in 1997 it became the ECMA-262 standard.

3. What types of programming is your language primarily used for (ex: web sites, video games,
mobile devices, parsing, etc.)? If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of
different projects it's been used for.

5. Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it?

At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website URLs, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular.
