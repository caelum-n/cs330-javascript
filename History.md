# JavaScript

### History of JavaScript

JavaScript, or JS, is one of several programming languages at the core of website design and function. It is frequently used in conjunction with HTML and CSS and should not be confused with Java, which is its own language. JavaScript is used on the client side by over 98% of websites for webpage behavior, often with third-party libraries. Since this language is so prevalent, all major web browsers include a dedicated Javascript engine to ensure code runs on users' devices.

### Inventor
Javascript was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich. It was developed for Netscape 2, and in 1997 it became the ECMA-262 standard. Prior to the invention of Javascript, the first popular web browser with a GUI, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Because it granted web access to non-technical folks, it played a big role in the growth of the world wide web. However, in 1994, the lead developers of Mosaic founded the Netscape corporation and released a more polished browser called Netscape Navigator

5. Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it?

At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website URLs, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular.
