### A (Less) Brief History 

JS was invented in 1995 by **Brendan Eich**, who was hired by the Netscape Corporation to embed a scripting language in their browser, Navigator. To really understand the context, let's back up a little.

In 1993, the web browser Mosaic was released and became the first popular browser with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI granted web access to many non-technical people and therefore played an important role in the rapid expansion of the World Wide Web. Soon after, in 1994, the lead developers of Mosaic founded the Netscape Corporation and released a more polished browser called Netscape Navigator, which quickly overtook Mosaic as the most popular.

At this point in time, web pages were completely [**static**]--meaning web pages had no dynamic capability once loaded. Web development was prospering and there was an impulse to overcome the limitations of static web pages. Thus, in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. On one hand, they hired Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language. They also hired Brendan Eich to embed the [Scheme language](https://www.scheme.org).

However, Netscape soon decided that it would be even better for Eich to develop an entirely new language that was closer in syntax to Java than to Scheme and other [extant scripting languages](#scripting-languages) like it. Originally, it was called LiveScript, but the name was soon changed to JavaScript by Netscape.

In the same year, Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer, which began a browser war between Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.
