## Introduction to JavaScript

### What Is JavaScript?

JavaScript, or JS, is one of several programming languages at the core of website design and function. It is frequently used in conjunction with HTML and CSS and should not be confused with [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html), which is its own language. JavaScript is used on the client side by over 98% of websites for webpage behavior, often with third-party libraries. Since this language is so prevalent, all major web browsers include a dedicated JavaScript engine to ensure code runs on users' devices.

### What's It Used For?

JavaScript is used in many more ways today than ever. Historically, Java had been used primarily on the client side to add scripted behavior. It remains the dominant client-side language of the web. However, after the [creation of Node.js in 2009](), JavaScript began to spread outside of browser usage. Now, JavaScript is used in server-side development, mobile app development, and more.

### A Brief History 

JS was invented in 1995 by [**Brendan Eich**](/moreInfo.md#a-less-brief-history), who was hired by the Netscape Corporation to embed a scripting language in their browser, Navigator. Navigator was one of the first popular web browsers with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing web browsing to spread through much wider, non-technical circles. Eich was originally hired to embed the programming language Scheme into Navigator, but it was soon decided that Eich would develop a new scripting language more similar to the Java programming language, instead of extant scripting languages like Scheme. Thus, LiveScript was born--and then it became JavaScript.[^1]
